# ![](media/Logo_Backgroundless_WarpToCrosshair.png) Warp-To-Crosshair Mod

> A client-side Fabric/NeoForge mod that teleports you to your crosshair in a click.

---

**Requires YetAnotherConfigLib.**

As said on the tin, this mod teleports you to the exactly where you are looking on the press of a button. This is 
enabled via requests to run vanilla server commands, allowing it to be client-side and respecting of server
OP / Moderator permissions.

The mod is configurable, with the button to teleport being configurable in the keybinds menu.
Furthermore, the buffer distance between the surface you're looking at and where you're teleported to can be configured
to make the teleports as precise or comfortable as you want.

By default, the key to teleport is ALT. I personally would use middle click, but you would need a non-conflict-keys mod
for this to work.

It's a simple mod. It probably won't get further features (other than visuals?). It works on all the major platforms.
